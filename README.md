# A Table Reservation System For A Restaurant

PROBLEM 

Your job is to create a reservation system for a restaurant.  The restaurant has N tables. You need to be able to provide following functionality for this system.   Let user reserve a table, or clear a reservation.

In a restaurant, there are multiple tables with varying seating capacities.
A table of a seating capacity of n can be booked for m people of a group such that m <= n.
A table can be re-booked for the same day only if there is a minimum T duration difference between 2 bookings.  
Booking can be done in fixed hours when the restaurant operates.

Your Task:

1.First, start with a design and identify the classes, data members and interfaces needed and how they will interact with each other.  Define all the entities need for this application and the assumptions you are going to make.

classes:
- Guest: id/ name/ phone_number
- Table: id/ capacity
- Reservation: 

make_reservation
show_tables
show_reservations
create_reservation

table_utilization


2.Implement the classes and interfaces defined above.


PROBLEM #2 (Extending your solution to add additional features via Feature Flags)


Suggest other “optional”  features you would like to add to your reservation system.  Depending on the client vendor, you should be able to enable/disable these features (Think of these features which would enhance your solution for customers)
